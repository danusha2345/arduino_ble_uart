## Using Bidirectional Communication

### Send Commands to GNSS Module
1. Connect to `um980_2` device via Bluetooth
2. Use any BLE terminal app (Serial Bluetooth Terminal, nRF Connect, etc.)
3. Send commands directly to GNSS module:
   ```
   CONFIG POS 55.7558 37.6176 123.45
   SAVECONFIG
   ```
4. Receive responses immediately in the same terminal

### Recommended Apps
- **Serial Bluetooth Terminal (Android/iOS)** â€” Best for command sending, auto-connects to Nordic UART Service
- **SW Maps (Android/iOS)** â€” External GNSS â†’ Generic NMEA (Bluetooth LE). Great for NTRIP corrections and positioning
- **nRF Connect (Android/iOS)** â€” Advanced diagnostics: connect, enable Notify on TX, write to RX
- Note: Classic SPP apps won't work; this is BLE GATT (NUS)
1. Connect to `um980_2` device via Bluetooth
2. Use any BLE terminal app (Serial Bluetooth Terminal, nRF Connect, etc.)
3. Send commands directly to GNSS module:
### Bidirectional Communication
1. **Phone â†’ ESP32 â†’ GNSS**: Commands sent via BLE RX characteristic go directly to UART1 TX
2. **GNSS â†’ ESP32 â†’ Phone**: NMEA data from UART1 RX goes to BLE TX characteristic

### Data Processing
1. GNSS â†” UART1 (460800 baud, bidirectional)
2. ESP32-C3 parses incoming NMEA messages:
   SAVECONFIG
   ```
4. Receive responses immediately in the same terminal

### Recommended Apps
4. Raw NMEA data forwarded over BLE NUS (Notify when subscribed; READ fallback)
- **SW Maps (Android/iOS)** â€” External GNSS â†’ Generic NMEA (Bluetooth LE). Great for NTRIP corrections and positioning
- **nRF Connect (Android/iOS)** â€” Advanced diagnostics: connect, enable Notify on TX, write to RX
- Note: Classic SPP apps won't work; this is BLE GATT (NUS)

## NMEA Data Flow

### Bidirectional Communication
1. **Phone â†’ ESP32 â†’ GNSS**: Commands sent via BLE RX characteristic go directly to UART1 TX
2. **GNSS â†’ ESP32 â†’ Phone**: NMEA data from UART1 RX goes to BLE TX characteristic

### Data Processing
1. GNSS â†” UART1 (460800 baud, bidirectional)
2. ESP32-C3 parses incoming NMEA messages:
   - **GSV**: visible satellites per system
   - **GSA**: used satellites (incl. GNGSA system mapping)
   - **GNS**: position, fix quality, satellites used
   - **GST**: coordinate accuracy (std dev)
3. Display updates (OLED/TFT) with dynamic precision and cm (tenths)
4. Raw NMEA data forwarded over BLE NUS (Notify when subscribed; READ fallback)

## Performance Notes

- Display updates: OLED â‰ˆ2 FPS, TFT â‰ˆ3 FPS; forced refresh every 30 s
- BLE send conditions: â‰¥500 bytes ready or 20â€“50 ms since last send
- UART ring buffer: 2048 bytes; overflow flagged in Serial log
- Subscription-aware: buffer not drained if no clients subscribed
- Time zone: local time shown; auto offset ~ round(longitude/15Â°), no DST
- Satellite timeout: 10 s; RTK accuracy timeout: 30 s

## Local Time & Time Zones

- **Time source**: UTC time extracted from NMEA GGA sentences (GPS time)
- What you see: the altitude line can show local time in `HH:MM:SS`.
- Default behavior: the firmware estimates time zone from longitude
  - Offset â‰ˆ round(longitude / 15Â°) hours, clamped from âˆ’12 to +14 hours.
  - Daylight saving time (DST) is not applied.
  - Because political time zones don't strictly follow longitude, the
    autoâ€‘offset can differ by Â±1 hour in some regions.
- Force a specific time zone offset (recommended if auto is wrong):
  - Edit `platformio.ini` in your environment block and add:
    - `build_flags = -DTZ_FORCE_OFFSET_MINUTES=<minutes>`
  - Examples (minutes from UTC):
    - St. Petersburg/Moscow: `180`
    - Berlin (standard time): `60`
    - Tokyo: `540`
    - New York (standard time): `-300` (or `-240` for daylight time)
  - Remove the flag to return to automatic estimation.
- Notes:
  - NMEA time is UTC; the firmware only adjusts display time.
  - No runtime UI yet; if needed, a BLE command/NVS setting can be added.
